# Simple PHP Website

This project is a basic PHP website built to demonstrate fundamental PHP and HTML structure. It serves as a starting point for learning PHP or for extending into a larger application.

## Requirements

* PHP 7+ (compatible with most standard PHP setups)
* A web server such as Apache, Nginx, or PHP’s built-in server

## How to Run

1. Place the project inside your web server’s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` or `www`).
2. Open a browser and navigate to the project folder
   (for example: `http://localhost/your-project-name/`).

Alternatively, you can use PHP’s built-in server:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Project Structure

* `index.php` — Main entry point of the website

## Notes

This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes. You can freely modify or expand it by adding more PHP files, styles, or functionality as needed.
